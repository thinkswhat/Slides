# Some slides

This repository will be used to store some of my slides, which may be formal or informal. I have used open source materials as much as possible to construct these materials, and you are welcome to freely use some or all of the content.

## [What can we expect from the data?](EDA)

This slide uses vivid graphic examples to illustrate some of the limitations of statistical methods and data-driven methods. In this era of unprecedented attention to artificial intelligence, some people may be looking for examples like these.

The materials used are sourced from the community, and I sincerely thank them.
