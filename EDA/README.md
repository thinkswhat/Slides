# What can we expect from the data?

I found this slide while organising my materials and reorganised it. This slide mainly discusses the shortcomings of statistical methods and data-driven methods, providing some examples that I think are worth looking at. Considering that some people may want to incorporate the content into their own speeches, I am sharing it here.

This slide uses R language and the Quarto framework.
